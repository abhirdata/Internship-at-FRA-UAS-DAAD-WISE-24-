Indoor air quality (IAQ) is pivotal for health and productivity, necessitating precise forecasting models. This study employs the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) to predict IAQ parameters, specifically CO2 levels, particulate matter (PM2.5), and temperature. Essential parameters—CO2 levels, PM2.5 concentrations, temperature, humidity, and volatile organic compounds—were gathered in real-time via a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) across three university rooms. The TFT model demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art models like LSTM, achieving Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) of 3.2 ppm for CO2, 0.03°C for temperature, and 0.177 µg/m³ for PM2.5. These findings underscore the TFT’s efficacy in enhancing IAQ management.
